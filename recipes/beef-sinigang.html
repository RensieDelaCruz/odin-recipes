    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>beef sinigang sa kamias is a Filipino soup dish commonly consumed on regular days. Bilimbi (locally known as
        <em>kamias</em>) serves as the souring agent. This delicous soup has a mild amount of sourness and an extra load
        of “deliciousness” brought about by all of its components.</p>
    <p>The beef in this sinigang na baka dish is so flavorful and tender, while the taro root adds a nice thick texture
        to the soup. I like how the “kamias” and tomato work together to bring out that nice sour flavor; adding a piece
        of Jalapeno also gave a hint of spice which made the overall experience enjoyable.</p>
