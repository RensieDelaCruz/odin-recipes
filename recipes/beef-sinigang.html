    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>beef sinigang sa kamias is a Filipino soup dish commonly consumed on regular days. Bilimbi (locally known as
        <em>kamias</em>) serves as the souring agent. This delicous soup has a mild amount of sourness and an extra load
        of “deliciousness” brought about by all of its components.
    </p>
    <p>The beef in this sinigang na baka dish is so flavorful and tender, while the taro root adds a nice thick texture
        to the soup. I like how the “kamias” and tomato work together to bring out that nice sour flavor; adding a piece
        of Jalapeno also gave a hint of spice which made the overall experience enjoyable.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs. beef chuck sliced into cibes</li>
        <li>2 medium tomato wedged</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion wedged</li>
        <li>10 to 12 pieces fresh or dried bilimbi kamias</li>
        <li>7 to 10 pieces okra</li>
        <li>4 pieces Indian eggplant sliced in half</li>
        <li>12 pieces string beans cut into 2 inch. length</li>
        <li>2 to 3 cups spinach or kangkong</li>
        <li>2 to 3 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>4 to 5 pieces taro root (gabi), peeled and cleaned</li>
        <li>9 cups water</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to cook</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the 5 cups water and beef broth in a cooking pot. Let boil.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato, onion, and kamias.Cook for 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the beef continue to boil in low to medium heat for 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Put the taro roots in the boiling mixture. Cook for another 45 minutes or until the beef gets tender.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, boil the remaining 4 cups of water in a second cooking pot.</li>
        <li>Once the water starts to boil, blanch the vegetables for 3 minutes (45 seconds for the spinach). (Blanching
            means cooking the vegetables in boiling water and then removing these quickly and place in a bowl with cold
            water.) Drain water and arrange the vegetables in a plate.</li>
        <li>Once the beef gets tender, add the fish sauce and stir. Note: you can add more water if needed.</li>
        <li>Transfer the beef, taro, and soup to individual bowls and arrange blanched vegetables on top.</li>
        <li>Serve warm. Share and enjoy!</li>
