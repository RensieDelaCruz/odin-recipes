    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pork sisig is a popular Filipino dish. It can be considered as a main dish or an appetizer. The composition of
        this dish is mainly of pig’s parts such as minced pork meat, ears, and face. Chicken liver, onions, and chili
        peppers are also added.</p>
    <p>As mentioned, Sisig can also be enjoyed as a main dish and is best eaten a cup of warm white rice on the side.
        Sisig is synonymous to <em>“pulutan”</em>. It is a term used to describe food pairings with beer or any alcohlic
        beverage. I like to pair it with either beer or wine.</p>
